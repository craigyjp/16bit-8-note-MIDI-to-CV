One of my favourite Stompbox circuits ever. Boiled this one (this is the "best-practice" example of an old stompbox classic) down to about half of the part count, got rid of the hiss. Beautiful creamy tube-like overdrive that doesn't stutter at low gain and, and doesn't fuzz-out at "eleven".

I'm way behind (work and family matters), but I put this here because I want to remember to try this. It's kind of "wave-shaping" after all, and it should be grand for solo patches or brass.
