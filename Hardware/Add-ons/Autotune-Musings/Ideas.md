1. Pin 1 and 2 of the 3340 are responsible for the scaling of the Tempco Generator. In most schems there is a resistor-flanked pot at Pin 1 named "scale adjust" or "V/Oct Trim". How very! I'll put a Digipot there instead and look at what it does. Maybe read the temperature of the chip and adjust accordingly? Looks like a table.
2. Pin 7 is named "HF Track" in the datasheet. TH puts a 10k pot there, wiper coming from the Exp. CV. Hm.
3. If we auto-tune the 3340 via a "Correction CV", maybe look at the linear CV input at Pin 13.
